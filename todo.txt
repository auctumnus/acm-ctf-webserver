this contains spoilers dont read it

its a paste server with a couple vulns

 - you can get any file if you just `../whatever.txt`
 - signatures are not checked in jwt
 - also you can xss. but theres no real use for it
 - you can also enumerate the users pretty easily. but again no real use
 - im tempted to just sha the passwords instead of bcrypt but i dont want bad stuff to happen if
   someone uses their real password
 - i would let you do sql injection but its genuinely just easier with this
   library to not. i love postgres
